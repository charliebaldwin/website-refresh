Hey there! My name's Charlie, and I'm a Technical Artist with a broad set of skills and interests.

My favorite thing about technical art is problem-solving.
I love digging into new technical challenges, learning new techniques and workflows, and ultimately coming out the other end with something sick looking.

My experience covers many areas within game development and real-time digital art, including 3D animation & character rigging,
shader development & optimization, tool & automation programming, UI design, and more.
