### list of achievements, learning targets, milestones, etc.
curating a list of technical milestones I've reached. The idea is I'm motivated by learning to do things I couldn't do before, so each new skill I pick up and get the hang of is a step towards having done everything in the world
put them in chronological order (most recent at the top probably), going as far back as I can come up with stuff for. Just a couple words or a short sentence about each, nothing too in-depth. Add to it as I work on miscellaneous side projects.
